# Computer-Like Mindset
I have always been one to mess around with any type of technology, whether it's snap circuits to raspberry pi's to starting to develop programs, its always been something. 

# Work
I currently work for a family friend who took me on just to get a bit of help for a few weekends. As time went on my value as an employee rose and now I can work whenever I have time and I hold responsibilities for big customers like Parlour Doughnuts, which I am in charge of fabricating and completing items like doughnut cases, window bars, booths, etc. This has really only been a summer job, but I don't think any other job could possibly teach anywhere close to the amount of skill that I have learned from this one.
